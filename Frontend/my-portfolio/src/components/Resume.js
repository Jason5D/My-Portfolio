        <h2>PERSONAL STATEMENT</h2>
        <p>
          Proficient junior software engineer with experience of designing,
          developing, and implementing software applications. Utilizing
          JavaScript and Python to write. With a strong background in technical
          sales roles, and supplying lighting technology to the construction
          industry, I’ve witnessed the transformative power of technology
          first-hand. My true passion lies in coding, which led me to enroll in
          the School of Code’s intensive boot camp. There, I honed my
          problem-solving skills and discovered how learning to code can drive
          innovation. I have agreed to support pre-enrolment on the course, and
          I also attend tech meetups to meet likeminded friends. In my spare
          time I have been learning new languages, getting to grips with data
          structures and algorithms, and have several personal projects I’m
          working on.
