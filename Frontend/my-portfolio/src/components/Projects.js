            Description of the project. This should be faily concise while also
            describing the key components that you developed or worked on. It
            can be as long as you need it to be but should at least be a few
            sentences long. Be sure to include specific links anywhere on the
            description. A link looks like
            <a href="https://studyosaurus.netlify.app/">this</a>.
