      <p>
      I'm a budding software developer with a fire for coding and a keen eye for solving difficult problems in innovative ways. Though I'm at the beginning of my journey, I've already dipped my toes into a variety of projects, learning and growing with each line of code I write. My journey is fueled by a passion for learning technology and a dream to create software that makes a difference.
