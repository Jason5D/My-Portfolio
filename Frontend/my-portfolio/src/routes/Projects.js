              This projects uses a common API which generates a total of 20 random questions, and can be played in the terminal or command line. Each round you win money and if you answer all 20 questions correctly, then you win Â£1 millon. I have made sure to make each question be randomly generated so that, it's very difficult to win. See if you can do it!
